# Jrn

An alternative student frontend for [dnevnik.egov66.ru](dnevnik.egov66.ru). Made with [sveltekit](kit.svelte.dev/) and hosted with [netlify](www.netlify.com).

Currently the only supported way to login is to literally `Ctrl+C` `Ctrl+V` your bearer token into the frontend after logging

## Contributing

This is a school project so do whatever you please, no one cares, just please don't be a dick.

Also the `prod` branch is deployed automatically, so don't mess with it.

## Building

I'm deploying with the netlify adapter but you can use whatever you want.

- Build: `npm run build`
- Run dev server: `npm run dev`
- Preview build: `npm run preview`
